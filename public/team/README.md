# Team Member Photos

Add team member photos to this folder.

**Supported formats**: JPG, PNG, WebP
**Recommended size**: 500x500px (square)

## Naming Convention

Use names that match team member names:
- `john-doe.jpg`
- `jane-smith.png`
- `president.jpg`

After adding images, update the image path in `src/data/team.json`:

```json
{
  "image": "/team/member-name.jpg"
}
```

## Note

Currently, the website uses placeholder initials. Add actual photos here and update the JSON to display them.
